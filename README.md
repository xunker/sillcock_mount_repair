This frame is used to mount a sillcock or outdoor faucet where the material
behind it has broken or crumbled.

I was replacing a sillcock on my house and found that the brick and mortar
where the original screws were had crumbled and there was no where to anchor
the new screws. I quickly made this frame to let me place new anchors in brick
that was still solid.

Customize the various diameters and sizes by changing the variables at the top
of `repair_frame.scad`.
